# IPL-Analysis
## Overview 
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of IPL data spanning from 2008 to 2022. The project focused on several key areas:

- **Player Statistics:** Analyzed individual player performance, including runs scored, wickets taken, batting averages, and strike rates.
* **Team-Wise Statistics:** Evaluated team performances, win/loss ratios, and overall team standings each season.
+ **Match Summaries:** Compiled detailed summaries of each match, highlighting key moments, top performers, and match outcomes.
- **Seasonal Statistics:**  Compared statistics across different seasons to identify trends, standout performances, and seasonal variations in team and player performances.
  
This analysis provided valuable insights into the performance patterns and trends in the IPL over the years, helping to understand the dynamics of the league better.
